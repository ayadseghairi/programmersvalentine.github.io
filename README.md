# **Valentine for programmers**
💔 *The bitter truth no one wants to admit: Programmers will never find love!* 💻💀  

If you think you're an exception and that someone truly loves you, you're living in a beautiful illusion... or maybe just a victim of a betrayal you haven’t discovered yet. 🥀🔪  

In this world, there are two types of people:  
1️⃣ Programmers who live in isolation with their code. 🖥️☕  
2️⃣ Those who don’t know how to code but think they have someone who loves them… or so they believe. 😏❤️  

🎯 If you're a programmer, send this site to your non-programmer friend who has a girlfriend—let him rethink his life choices! 😉

As for us? We don’t need love… We have code, debugging, and long nights filled with heartbreak caused by errors more than any person ever could. 😩💾  

Enjoy coding, because you won’t find anything else worth your time. 🚀🔥
